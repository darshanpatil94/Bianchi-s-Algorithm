Description

IEEE 802.11 networks utilize CSMA/CA with binary exponential backoff to avoid collisions. This mechanism is referred to as distributed cordinated function.
In this project, we validate the analytical model presented by bianchi for computing the saturation throughput performance of the 802.11 protocol using Matlab and NS-3.
we focused on the basic mode of 802.11 (without RTS/CTS). Compared the results obtained from Matlab and NS-3.
